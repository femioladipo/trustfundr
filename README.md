# trustfundr

Awesome — “TrustFundr” has real legs as both a demoable MVP and a viable long-term product. Let’s flesh it out into a proper architecture, features roadmap, and MVP scope that your team can build during the hackathon without going crazy. 😄

💼 Project: TrustFundr — Onchain AI Trust Fund Agent

🔑 Tagline:

	Autonomous, multi-chain financial assistant that safely manages and disburses digital assets based on programmable logic — all via a chatbot.

🧠 Core Use Case

	Users set up a digital trust fund that can send funds (e.g., BTC, ICP, ETH, CHAT) automatically to other users on specific conditions:

	•	“Send 0.01 BTC to my child every week”
	•	“Release $ICP when my friend messages ‘I need funds’ in OpenChat”
	•	“Send $CHAT tokens on their birthday automatically”

The TrustFundr AI Agent handles logic, listens to commands, and interacts with chains via ICP’s Chain Key Crypto, LLM, timers, and HTTPS outcalls.

🏗️ Project Architecture

✅ MVP Focus (for hackathon)

Component	Tech	Role
🤖 Agent Logic	Rust/Motoko	Canister that stores trust fund logic + state
🧠 LLM Agent	LLM Canister	Converts user OpenChat messages into fund actions
💬 Chat Interface	OpenChat Bot SDK	Interacts with users via bot in OpenChat
🔒 Wallet Ops	Chain Key Crypto (mocked or real ICP/BTC)	Signs txs (or simulates in MVP)
🌐 Frontend	ICP-hosted HTML/TS	Basic dashboard to see trust setup
⏲️ Timer	ICP Canister Timer	Runs payout logic periodically

🪜 Phased Features

🏁 Hackathon MVP (core loop working)
	•	Canister-based agent that tracks a list of trust fund rules
	•	LLM interprets messages like “start weekly BTC payment to @alice”
	•	OpenChat bot reads messages and calls canister
	•	Timer triggers the scheduled payment logic (mocked or to testnet BTC)
	•	Simple frontend: list of active trusts, log of actions
	•	Deployed canister with demo video + GitHub repo

🚀 Post-hackathon roadmap (real-world product)
	•	Connect to real BTC/ETH testnet or mainnet (via Chain Key)
	•	UI for managing recipients, frequency, amount, limits
	•	Full LLM natural language interface for trust config and updates
	•	Integrate OTP/auth for modifying funds
	•	Add NFTs/multisig rules (e.g., require 2 trustees to release)
	•	“Dead man’s switch” feature: trigger funds if user inactive
	•	Interact with external oracles via HTTPS (e.g., weather, court APIs, etc.)

🧪 Example User Stories (MVP)

Persona	Goal	Chat Message
Parent	Set up weekly allowance	“Send @alice 0.005 BTC every Friday”
Friend	Emergency payout	“Release 100 ICP to @bob if he says ‘I need help’”
Employer	Monthly salary	“Pay @carol 300 ICP on the 1st of every month”

🧪 Demo Setup
	•	✅ Pre-fill one “trust” setup between mock users @demo_user and @recipient
	•	✅ Show live chat with bot: “start weekly 5 ICP payments to @recipient”
	•	✅ LLM returns parsed structure:

{
  "recipient": "@recipient",
  "amount": "5 ICP",
  "frequency": "weekly",
  "token": "ICP"
}


	•	✅ Canister stores it
	•	✅ Timer logs mock payout after X seconds (simulate weekly payment)
	•	✅ Show frontend dashboard with log of action

  Absolutely — strong real-world use cases will help justify why TrustFundr matters and show judges (or future users/investors) that it’s more than just a “cool demo.” Here’s a list of compelling scenarios across personal finance, legal, DAOs, and philanthropy:

🧍‍♂️ Personal Use Cases

1. Digital Allowance for Children or Teens

	“Send 0.01 BTC to my daughter every Sunday morning until she turns 18.”

	•	Automates trust-like behavior
	•	Parents don’t need to manually manage funds
	•	Could include conditions like “only if she checks in via OpenChat once per week”

2. Emergency Fund Release

	“If I message ‘I’m in trouble’, release $1,000 USDC to @emergency_contact.”

	•	Useful for traveling, living in unstable regions, or dealing with health concerns
	•	Could include AI validation of the message before releasing funds

3. “Dead Man’s Switch”

	“If I don’t respond in 30 days, send 1 ETH to @lawyer and my estate details to @brother.”

	•	Vital for people in risky professions, digital nomads, crypto-native users
	•	Fully autonomous, with optional multi-party confirmation

⚖️ Legal & Estate Planning Use Cases

4. Living Trust Fund

	“Release 500 ICP monthly to my sibling from my crypto estate until it runs out.”

	•	Simple, automated inheritance layer without a centralized custodian
	•	Could be backed by multisig or biometric proof for more complex estate setups

5. Conditional Divorce/Alimony Agreement

	“Send 200 USDT every 1st of the month, unless @ex-spouse fails to confirm via chat.”

	•	Funds only release if both parties confirm
	•	Useful for digital nomads, cross-border payments, or trustless arrangements

🤝 DAO & Web3 Community Use Cases

6. DAO Payroll Automation

	“Send 100 CHAT to each contributor in the #dev-team OpenChat group every Friday.”

	•	On-chain DAO pays devs with no manual intervention
	•	Easily integrates with multisig rules and OpenChat’s group features

7. Contest or Grant Payouts

	“Release 50 ICP to winners if they submit the final product within 2 weeks.”

	•	Automated incentives for hackathons, accelerators, or grants
	•	Uses ICP’s timer + LLM canister to validate submitted results

🌍 Philanthropy & Social Good

8. Charity with Accountability

	“Send 10 ICP to @ngo-org each month, but only if they share a photo or message proving activity.”

	•	LLM could validate proof (e.g., OpenChat photo + description)
	•	Auto-pause if no updates are posted

9. Support for Refugees or Crisis Victims

	“Let @trusted-aid-org distribute 0.1 BTC/day across verified recipients. Log all actions onchain.”

	•	Transparent and programmable fund release
	•	Cross-chain distribution powered by ICP’s multi-chain support

10. Recurring Micro-Donations

	“Donate 1 ICP to @local-climate-dao every month, unless I pause it in chat.”

	•	AI agents manage small automated giving schedules
	•	Chatbot interface makes it accessible for non-technical users

🧠 Bonus Concepts with Advanced Agent Logic

11. Auto-Rebalancing Family Fund

	“Maintain 60/40 ETH/BTC allocation for my kids’ savings, rebalance monthly.”

	•	Combines AI + chain fusion for onchain financial logic
	•	Could use secure randomness to select rebalance dates, avoid frontrunning

12. Multi-generational Trusts

	“Release 100 ICP/year to my grandchildren if they meet AI-verified milestones.”

	•	Works like a “living will” with programmable logic + AI verification
	•	Milestones: education, community contribution, OpenChat participation
